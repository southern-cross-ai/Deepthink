# 👾🚀 Guild AI Team (Deepthink) - AI x GameDev Playground 🎮🤖

Hey there! Welcome to the **Guild AI Team (Deepthink)** README! We are a group of game developers and AI enthusiasts on a mission to explore the power of **ChatGPT inside Unreal Engine 5**. Our goal is to leverage AI to **generate game content, automate tasks, and push the boundaries of procedural generation**! 💡🔥

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

### 🌟 Our Mission:
- **Unreal Engine Plugin Development** 🎛 — Seamlessly integrate **ChatGPT API** into **UE5**.
- **AI-Assisted Content Generation** ✍ — Missions, dialogues, items… even **procedural level generation**.
- **Python x OpenAI API** 🐍 — Enable smooth communication between **UE5 scripts** and **ChatGPT**.
- **Editor Utility Widget** 🛠 — Create a user-friendly tool for quick AI-assisted content generation inside UE5.
- **Lay the Groundwork for the Future** 🏗 — Document best practices and future development paths.

---

## 🏗 Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Enable Python Editor Scripting
- Ensure **UE5 project supports Python scripting**.
- Use **Epic’s Python Editor Script Plugin** or the **open-source UnrealEnginePython plugin**.
- Create basic **test scripts** that can **read and modify** assets within Unreal.

### ✅ Step 2: Set Up a Basic ChatGPT Script
- Use Python’s **openai library** to authenticate with the **ChatGPT API**.
- Write a **standalone test script** outside Unreal to verify communication with OpenAI.
- Send **sample prompts** and process responses.

### ✅ Step 3: Bridge Unreal with ChatGPT
- Integrate ChatGPT logic into **Python files that Unreal can call**.
- Example:
  - **"GenerateNPCDialogue.py"** — Takes **Unreal asset context**, queries ChatGPT, and injects AI-generated text back into the asset’s properties.
- Implement this through either **UE5’s scripting environment** or a **custom Editor Utility Widget**.

### ✅ Step 4: Build an Editor Utility Widget (Optional but Recommended)
- Create a **simple UI** inside Unreal to trigger the Python script.
- Example UI Features:
  - **Input field** for a "prompt style".
  - **Generate button** to call ChatGPT.
  - **Live preview** of generated AI content.

### ✅ Step 5: Expand & Improve
- Add **more advanced features**:
  - Improved **prompt engineering**.
  - **Iterative conversation context** for refined outputs.
  - Integration with **Blueprint triggers**.
- Consider **performance, API rate limits, and cost optimization**.

## 🔭 Future Work & Ideas

### 🚀 Enhancements & Expansions
- **AI-driven asset placement**: Let ChatGPT place objects in a scene based on textual descriptions.
- **Procedural mission and quest generation**: Generate storylines dynamically.
- **Smart NPCs**: Give AI-generated personalities, dialogues, and decision trees.
- **AI-powered level design**: Experiment with ChatGPT-based procedural world generation.
- **Multiplayer AI integration**: Investigate how AI-driven content can impact **multiplayer experiences**.

### 📖 Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain a **step-by-step guide** for future developers.
- Document **best practices for integrating AI with Unreal Engine**.
- Provide **detailed instructions on how to continue development beyond the semester**.
