# 👋 Hello, World!

Hey! I'm B Z, a developer who loves to experiment, currently exploring the magic combination of game development and AI. 🚀 Right now, I'm working on **Unreal Engine + ChatGPT**, letting AI assist in game content creation—or at least helping us write less code! 🎮💡

## 🔥 Upcoming Work: Bringing ChatGPT into Unreal Engine 5!

Our team's mission is simple (Really?)—**integrating ChatGPT into UE5**, making AI a part of game development. Specifically:

- **Build an Unreal Plugin** 💾— Research the best way to integrate ChatGPT API into UE5 so it runs directly in the editor.
- **Let AI Generate Game Content** ✍— Experiment with AI-generated missions, dialogues, items… maybe even procedural level generation?
- **Connect Everything with Python** 🐍— Ensure that Python scripts in UE5 can communicate with the OpenAI API, allowing AI-generated content to be seamlessly injected into the game.
- **Create a Handy Tool** 🛠— Possibly build an **Editor Utility Widget** for one-click AI content generation.
- **Leave a Legacy** 🏗— Document our best practices and learnings to pave the way for future developers (and our future selves!).

Our ultimate goal? **To make ChatGPT the scriptwriter, level designer, and NPC generator for game development!** 🎭🎮
