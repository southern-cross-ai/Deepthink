Hello everyone,

I'm Dongze Yu, and I'm thrilled to have recently joined the AI team focused on game development. With a background in software engineering and a passion for both AI and gaming, I'm looking forward to contributing to our projects and learning from all of you.

I have experience in various programming languages and development environments, and I'm particularly interested in how AI can enhance the gaming experience by making it more interactive and immersive.

I'm eager to collaborate with you all and see what amazing things we can create together. Let's make some great games!

Best regards,
Dongze Yu
