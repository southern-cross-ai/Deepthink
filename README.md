## 🎯 Our Mission

DeepThink is an AI-driven research team under **Guild AI**, dedicated to exploring innovative ways of integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into **Unreal Engine 5**. Our primary objective is to streamline the interaction between **ChatGPT API** and **Unreal Engine**, enabling seamless AI-powered content creation.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

### 🏗️ **Building an Unreal Plugin for LLM Integration**
- Investigate the most effective approach to integrating **ChatGPT API calls** into Unreal as a **plugin**.
- Leverage **existing tools and frameworks** to maximize efficiency and minimize redundant efforts.
- Establish a **baseline** by identifying the best practices currently available.

### 🎮 **Expanding AI-Driven Content Authoring**
- **Placing assets dynamically**: Use LLM APIs to automatically position and configure assets in Unreal scenes.
- **Procedural content generation**: Utilize AI to assist the content team in generating:
  - 📜 New missions and quest lines.
  - 🎭 Story-driven NPC dialogues.
  - 🎁 New items, world objects, and interactive components.
- **Optimizing AI-assisted workflows** for more immersive world-building inside Unreal Engine.

### 🚀 **Laying the Foundation for Future Development**
- Identify **long-term technical requirements** for LLM integration beyond the current project scope.
- Provide **comprehensive documentation** and **clear development guidelines** to enable future teams to build upon our work.
- Establish a **scalable framework** to support **next-gen AI content generation** inside Unreal.

## 🌍 Why It Matters
By bridging the gap between **LLMs and game development**, DeepThink aims to revolutionize how interactive content is created. Our research will **empower designers, developers, and storytellers** to bring new levels of dynamic AI-driven creativity into Unreal Engine 5. 

🚀 *Join us as we shape the future of AI-assisted game development!* 🎮
