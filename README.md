# 👾🚀 Guild AI Team (Deepthink) - AI x GameDev Playground 🎮🤖

Hey there! Welcome to the **Guild AI Team (Deepthink)** README! We are a group of game developers and AI enthusiasts on a mission to explore the power of **ChatGPT inside Unreal Engine 5**. Our goal is to leverage AI to **generate game content, automate tasks, and push the boundaries of procedural generation**! 💡🔥

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

### 🌟 Our Mission:
- **Unreal Engine Plugin Development** 🎛 — Seamlessly integrate **ChatGPT API** into **UE5**.
- **AI-Assisted Content Generation** ✍ — Missions, dialogues, items… even **procedural level generation**.
- **Python x OpenAI API** 🐍 — Enable smooth communication between **UE5 scripts** and **ChatGPT**.
- **Editor Utility Widget** 🛠 — Create a user-friendly tool for quick AI-assisted content generation inside UE5.
- **Lay the Groundwork for the Future** 🏗 — Document best practices and future development paths.

## 🏗 Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Setting Up Python for Unreal Engine
To enable Unreal Engine to interact with Python, we first need to ensure that **Python scripting is supported** within the engine. This can be achieved using **Epic’s built-in Python Editor Script Plugin** or opting for the **community-driven UnrealEnginePython plugin**. Once enabled, we will develop **simple scripts that interact with Unreal assets**, ensuring that we can **read, modify, and manipulate** game objects via Python commands.

### ✅ Step 2: Establishing a Connection with ChatGPT
Before integrating ChatGPT into Unreal, we will first create a **standalone Python script** that can communicate with the **OpenAI API**. Using the **openai library**, we will authenticate with the service, send **test prompts**, and validate the responses. This will serve as the foundation for all AI-driven interactions within Unreal.

### ✅ Step 3: Integrating ChatGPT into Unreal Engine
Once we have a functioning API connection, the next step is embedding this capability into **Python scripts that Unreal Engine can execute**. This involves creating scripts that **retrieve context from Unreal assets**, generate AI-driven content via ChatGPT, and **seamlessly inject** the results back into Unreal’s properties. For example, we could develop a script like **"GenerateNPCDialogue.py"**, where AI-generated dialogue dynamically populates an NPC’s text field.

### ✅ Step 4: Developing an Editor Utility Widget
Depending on the project's progress and requirements, we may explore the development of a **custom Editor Utility Widget** to enhance usability. This widget could provide an intuitive interface for triggering AI interactions inside Unreal. However, its necessity will depend on how effectively other methods integrate ChatGPT into the workflow. Potential features of the widget might include:
- A **text input field** for specifying styles or context for AI-generated content.
- A **Generate button** to call ChatGPT and retrieve relevant data.
- A **real-time preview window** to display AI-generated results immediately.

### ✅ Step 5: Expanding Capabilities & Optimizing Performance
Once the basic system is in place, we will refine it by:
- **Improving prompt structuring** to yield more relevant and high-quality AI responses.
- **Implementing iterative content generation**, allowing for back-and-forth refinement of AI-generated assets.
- **Integrating with Unreal Blueprints**, so AI-driven content can dynamically interact with in-game mechanics.
- **Optimizing performance and monitoring API usage** to ensure smooth execution without excessive costs.

## 🔭 Future Work & Ideas

### 🚀 Enhancements & Expansions
- **AI-driven asset placement**: Let ChatGPT place objects in a scene based on textual descriptions.
- **Procedural mission and quest generation**: Generate storylines dynamically.
- **Smart NPCs**: Give AI-generated personalities, dialogues, and decision trees.
- **AI-powered level design**: Experiment with ChatGPT-based procedural world generation.
- **Multiplayer AI integration**: Investigate how AI-driven content can impact **multiplayer experiences**.

### 📖 Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain a **step-by-step guide** for future developers.
- Document **best practices for integrating AI with Unreal Engine**.
- Provide **detailed instructions on how to continue development beyond the semester**.
